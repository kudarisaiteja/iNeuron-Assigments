1. Explain the advantages of Natural Queries in PowerBi with an example?
a.Sometimes the fastest way to get an answer from your data is to perform a search over your data using natural language. The Q&A feature in Power BI
 lets you explore your data in your own words using natural language. Q&A is interactive, even fun. Often, one question leads to others as the visualizations
 reveal interesting paths to pursue. Asking the question is just the beginning. Travel through your data, refining or expanding your question, uncovering new 
 information, zeroing in on details, or zooming out for a broader view. The experience is interactive and fast, powered by an in-memory storage.
 
 example- Even before you start typing, Q&A displays a new screen with suggestions to help you form your question. Start either from one of the suggested questions 
 or type your own questions. Q&A supports a wide range of questions, including but not limited to.

 2.Explain Web Front End(WFE) cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?

 a.The Power BI service architecture is based on two clusters â€“ the Web Front End (WFE) cluster and the Back-End cluster. The WFE cluster manages the initial connection
 and authentication to the Power BI service, and once authenticated.
 b.The WFE cluster provides the user's browser with the initial HTML page contents on site load, as well as pointers to CDN content used to render the site in the browser.

 3. Explain Back End cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?

  data refresh, data connections, and other aspects of interacting with the Power BI service

  4. What ASP.NET component does in Power BI Service Architecture?
  a. ASP.NET(Active Server Pages Network Enabled Technologies)  When users attempt to connect to the Power BI service, the client's DNS service may communicate with the Azure Traffic Manager
   to find the most appropriate (usually nearest) datacenter with a Power BI deployment.

Reporting - reporting we can done by using both but in power bi we have different kinds of visualizations. But in the Excel limited.
Server Deployment - Power Bi has front and back service deployemnts but excel doent have.
Convert Models - it is easy to convert models in Power bi but in the excel not possible.
