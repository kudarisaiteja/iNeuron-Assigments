2.What limitations of Excel, Microsoft solved by PowerBi?
a. Excel has limitations in the amount of data it can work with. In contrast, Power BI can handle much larger amounts of data. Power BI can connect 
to a large number of data sources, while Excel's connectivity capacity is limited. Also, unlike Excel, Power BI can be easily used from mobile devices.

 4. Explain PowerMap?
 a.  We all have used and inserted the Maps and 3D Maps in MS Excel which is quite complex to implement when we know that the tool which we are using is not meant for creating Map charts. 
 To overcome such situations, Microsoft has given many such options and functions in Power BI which are not easy to use in MS Excel. Maps are one of those charts in Power BI. Now the question comes,
 how Power BI detects the locations which we have in our data and plot that into charts? And the answer is, through Bing Maps which is also a Microsoft product. Bing Maps locates the city, 
 country and region name with the exact name and fill that into Power BI Maps.
